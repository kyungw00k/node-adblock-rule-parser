# node-adblock-rule-parser
> `node-adblock-rule-parser` is a package for working with Adblock filter rules. It can parse Adblock Plus filters and match URLs against them.

But it is deprecated already, because I found the great easylist filter parser [abp2blocklist](https://github.com/adblockplus/abp2blocklist), which is working perfect.
 
 If you want to do something with [easylist.txt](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt), use [abp2blocklist](https://github.com/adblockplus/abp2blocklist)!
